### Basic MERN stack with CRUD

To install:

Dependenies I used:

`npm i`

To run:

`npm start`

This was adapated from tutorial from https://www.djamware.com/post/59faec0a80aca7739224ee1f/building-crud-web-application-using-mern-stack for a book library app.

And I'll use this to make my own more original app
